This program is made available for free personal use but is not licensed for distribution, etc. And tbh ppl shouldn't even be using it at all.

Some of the shader functions were copied and pasted from public sources, but are largely implementing trivial algorithms, &c. This code is being made available in the interest of transparency and to advance the cause of the hexagonal arts, and should not be construed as implying that future releases will be available, or licensed under any sort of permissive regime.
